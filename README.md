# codeguesser

### About
A terminal version of geoguesser but for programming languages. 
<br/>User is given a snippet of code and has to name the programming language it was written in.

### Usage
1. Download the project as a ZIP and run `main.py`
2. That's it!

### Features
1. Config System : Reads and applies settings, dev options and more from `codeguesser.cfg`
2. Points Encryption : 'Encrypts' and 'Decrypts' the points when necessary to avoid point tampering.
   - Can be easily bypassed as it's just simple hex encoding and unencoding, but it's fun nonetheless.
3. Start Screen : Allows you to choose between `1. Start Game` and `2. Check Points`. Needs to be fixed as I left it unfinished.

### Future
You can read what I had planned for the project in `planning.txt`. 
- I did add some of the planned features but I probably won't work on this project anytime soon as I have uni now.
  - Will maybe fix the start screen function so the program becomes usable again.

Yes, it needs some work, but I'm proud of it as it was one of my first projects with an original idea.
