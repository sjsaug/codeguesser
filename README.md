# codeguesser

### About
A terminal version of geoguesser but for programming languages. 
<br/>User is given a snippet of code and has to name the programming language it was written in.

### Usage
1. Download the project as a ZIP and run `main.py`
2. That's it!

### Future
I probably won't work on this project again as I have uni now
<br/> Yes, it's pretty barebones and needs some work, but I'm proud of it as it was one of the first original project ideas I had.
