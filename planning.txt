- Going to use same idea as typing test where we take samples from a file,
but in this case it'll be code snippets instead of words
  - I'm prob going to use different files for each programming language
  If we want to have more than one code snippet for each language we need
  to figure out how to store/get different code snippets in each language
  file.
    - But, to start and to build the base code, I'm going to only use one
    code snippet for each language and I can figure out how to do the
    above later

- I will prob use rand library to choose which language to pick a snippet
from and then use if statements to choose the snippet, and also to set the
language variable to check if the user guessed the correct language

- All we need after that is to display the code snippet on screen and
get the users guess as input, then check that agains the language var
and if they got it right award them points and then start with a new
snippet.

- To expand this, first I can add a timer limit and different gamemode
selections, as well as actually track the users points in a file.

- The end goal is to have this on a website, so I will eventually have
to port this code onto a website or convert it into a language built for
web development (I have no idea how web development works).

- Need to add a way for the user to easily differentiate the code snippets from the prompts, making it coloured seems good but maybe a gui will be better, except that defeats the purpose of it being in the terminal and need to implement above feature ideas before moving to gui
