- Going to use same idea as typing test where we take samples from a file,
but in this case it'll be code snippets instead of words
  - I'm prob going to use different files for each programming language
  If we want to have more than one code snippet for each language we need
  to figure out how to store/get different code snippets in each language
  file.
    - But, to start and to build the base code, I'm going to only use one
    code snippet for each language and I can figure out how to do the
    above later

- Award user points (and track the points in a file) for correct guess and start a new test (restart main)

- The end goal is to have this on a website, so I will eventually have
to port this code onto a website or convert it into a language built for
web development (I have no idea how web development works).

- Need to add a way for the user to easily differentiate the code snippets from the prompts, making it coloured seems good but maybe a gui will be better, except that defeats the purpose of it being in the terminal and need to implement above feature ideas before moving to gui
